          <h3>End-Times Mural</h3>
          <p>I designed this mural to use leftover paint from a previous mural.<br>
          Because of the limited amount of paint, I stuck to primary colors to prevent wasting while mixing.<br>       
          The folkart design was inspired by the limited color palette.</p>
